2 ^ O Lord my God, in thee have I put my trust~; save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me.
3 ^ Lest at any time he seize upon my soul like a lion, while there is no one to redeem me, nor to save.
4 ^ O Lord, my God, if I have done this thing, if there be iniquity in my hands,
5 ^ if I have rendered to them that repaid me evils, let me deservedly fall empty before my enemies.
6 ^ Let the enemy pursue my soul, and take it, and tread down my life, on the earth, and bring down my glory to the dust.
7 ^ Rise up, O Lord, in thy anger~; be thou exalted in the borders of my enemies, and arise, O Lord my God, in the precept which thou hast commanded.
8 ^ And a congregation of people shall surround thee, and for their sakes return thou on high.
9 ^ The Lord judgeth the people. Judge me, O Lord, according to my justice, and according to my innocence in me.
10 ^ The wickedness of sinners shall be brought to nought, and thou shalt direct the just, the searcher of hearts and reins is God.
11 ^ Just is my help from the Lord, who saveth the upright of heart.
12 ^ God is a just judge, strong and patient~; whether he be angred throughout each day~?
13 ^ Except you will be converted, he will brandish his sword~; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.
14 ^ And in it he hath prepared to instruments of death, he hath made ready his arrows for them that burn.
15 ^ Behold he hath been in labour with injustice~; he hath conceived sorrow, and brought forth iniquity.
16 ^ He hath opened a pit and dug it, and he is fallen into the hole, which he made.
17 ^ His sorrow shall be turned on his own head, and his iniquity shall come down upon his crown.
18 ^ I will give glory to the Lord according to his justice, and will sing to the name of the Lord the most high.
