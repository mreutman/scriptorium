2 ^ I cried to the Lord with my voice~; to God with my voice, and he gave ear to me.
3 ^ In the days of my trouble I sought God, with my hands lifted up to him in the night, and I was not deceived~; my soul refused to be comforted.
4 ^ I remembered God, and was delighted, and was exercised, and my spirit swooned away.
5 ^ My eyes prevented the watches~; I was troubled, and I spoke not.
6 ^ I thought upon the days of old, and I had in my mind the eternal years.
7 ^ And I meditated in the night with my own heart, and I was exercised and I swept my spirit.
8 ^ Will God then cast off for ever, and will he never be more favourable again~?
9 ^ Or will he cut off his mercy for ever, from generation to generation~?
10 ^ Or will God forget to show mercy~? Or will he in his anger shut up his mercies~?
11 ^ And I said, "Now have I begun~; this is the change of the right hand of the most High."
12 ^ I remembered the works of the Lord, for I will be mindful of thy wonders from the beginning.
13 ^ And I will meditate on all thy works, and will be employed in thy inventions.
14 ^ Thy way, O God, is in the holy place~; who is the great God like our God~?
15 ^ Thou art the God that dost wonders~; thou hast made thy power known among the nations.
16 ^ With thy arm thou hast redeemed thy people, the children of Jacob and of Joseph.
17 ^ The waters saw thee, O God~; the waters saw thee, and they were afraid, and the depths were troubled.
18 ^ Great are the roarings of the waters~; the clouds sent out a sound, and indeed thy arrows pass.
19 ^ The voice of thy thunder in a wheel~; thy lightnings enlightened the world~; the earth shook and trembled.
20 ^ Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in many waters, and thy footsteps shall not be known.
21 ^ Thou hast conducted thy people like sheep, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
