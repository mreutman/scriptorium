1 ^ Out of the depths I have cried to thee, O Lord.
2 ^ Lord, hear my voice~; let thy ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication.
3 ^ If thou, O Lord, should have marked iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand it~?
4 ^ For with thee there is merciful forgiveness.
5 ^ By reason of thy law, I have waited for thee, O Lord~; my soul hath relied on his word.
6 ^ My soul hath hoped in the Lord from the morning watch even until night~; let Israel hope in the Lord.
7 ^ Because with the Lord there is mercy, and with him plentiful redemption.
8 ^ And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
