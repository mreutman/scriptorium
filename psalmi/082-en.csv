2 ^ O God, who shall be like to thee? Hold not thy peace, neither be thou still, O God,
3 ^ for behold thy enemies have made a noise, and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
4 ^ They have taken a malicious counsel against thy people, and have consulted against thy saints.
5 ^ They have said, "Come, and let us destroy them so that they be not a nation, and let the name of Israel be remembered no more."
6 ^ For they have contrived with one consent; they have made a covenant together against thee,
7 ^ the tabernacles of the Edomites and the Ishmahelites, of Moab and the Hagarens,
8 ^ of Gebal and Ammon and Amalec, of the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre,
9 ^ and even the Assyrian is joined with them, they are come to the aid of the sons of Lot.
10 ^ Do to them as thou didst to Midian and to Sisera, as to Jabin at the brook of Kison.
11 ^ Who perished at Endor; and became as dung for the earth.
12 ^ Make their princes like Oreb and Zeeb and Zebah and Zalmunna; all their princes,
13 ^ who have said, «Let us possess the sanctuary of God for an inheritance.»
14 ^ O my God, make them like a wheel, and as stubble before the wind.
15 ^ As fire which burneth the wood, and as a flame burning mountains,
16 ^ so shalt thou pursue them with thy tempest, and shalt trouble them in thy wrath.
17 ^ Fill their faces with shame, and they shall seek thy name, O Lord.
18 ^ Let them be ashamed and troubled for ever and ever, and let them be confounded and perish.
19 ^ And let them know that the Lord is thy name; thou alone art the Most High over all the earth.
