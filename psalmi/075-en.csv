2 ^ In Judea God is known~; his name is great in Israel.
3 ^ And his place is in peace, and his abode in Sion.
4 ^ There hath he broken the powers of bows, the shield, the sword, and the battle.
5 ^ Thou enlightenest wonderfully from the everlasting hills.
6 ^ All the foolish of heart were troubled~; they have slept their sleep, and all the men of riches have found nothing in their hands.
7 ^ At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, they have all slumbered that mounted on horseback.
8 ^ Thou art terrible, and who shall resist thee~? From that time is thy wrath.
9 ^ Thou hast caused judgment to be heard from heaven~; the earth trembled and was still,
10 ^ when God arose in judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.
11 ^ For the thought of man shall give praise to thee, and the remainders of the thought shall keep holiday to thee.
12 ^ Vow ye, and pay to the Lord your God~; all you that are round about him bring presents to him that is terrible,
13 ^ and to him who taketh away the spirit of princes~; to the terrible before the kings of the earth.
