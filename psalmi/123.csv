1 ^ Nisi qŭia Dòminus èrat in nobîs, dícat nunc Isráhel, ^ If it had not been that the Lord was with us, let Israel now say,
2 ^ nisi qŭia Dòminus èrat in nobîs, qŭum exsurgérent hòmines in nos, ^ if it had not been that the Lord was with us, when men rose up against us,
3 ^ forte vivos degluttivìssent nos, qŭum irascerétur furor eórum in nos~; ^ perhaps they had swallowed us up alive, when their fury was enkindled against us~;
4 ^ fórsitan aqŭa absorbuìsset nos~; torrèntem pertransívit ánima nostra~; ^ perhaps the water had swallowed us up~; our soul hath passed through a torrent~;
5 ^ fórsitan pertransivìsset ánima nostra aqŭam intolerábilem. ^ perhaps our soul had passed through a water insupportable.
6 ^ Benedìctus Dòminus, qŭi non dèdit nos, in captiónem dèntibus eórum. ^ Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us to be a prey to their teeth.
7 ^ Ánima nostra sicut passer erèpta èst de láqŭeo venántium~; láqueus contrítus èst, et nos liberáti sùmus. ^ Our soul like a sparrow hath been delivered from the snare of the hunters~; the snare is broken, and we are delivered.
8 ^ Adjutórium nostrum in nómine Dòmini, qŭi fecit caĕlum et terram. ^ Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
