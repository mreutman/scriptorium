1 ^ Sing ye to the Lord a new canticle~; let his praise be in the church of the saints.
2 ^ Let Israel rejoice in him that made him, and let the children of Sion be joyful in their king.
3 ^ Let them praise his name in choir~; let them sing to him with the timbrel and the psaltery.
4 ^ For the Lord is well pleased with his people, and he will exalt the meek unto salvation.
5 ^ The saints shall rejoice in glory~; they shall be joyful in their beds.
6 ^ The high praises of God shall be in their mouths, and two-edged swords in their hands~;
7 ^ to execute vengeance upon the nations, chastisements among the people~;
8 ^ to bind their kings with fetters, and their nobles with manacles of iron~;
9 ^ to execute upon them the judgment that is written~; this glory is to all his saints. Alleluia.
