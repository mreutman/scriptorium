1 ^ Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.
2 ^ Like the precious ointment on the head, that runneth down upon the beard, the beard of Aaron, which runneth down to the edge of his garment~;
3 ^ as the dew of Hermon, which descendeth upon mount Sion. For there the Lord hath commanded blessing, and life for evermore.
