2 ^ O God, we have heard with our ears~; our fathers have declared to us, the work thou hast wrought in their days, and in the days of old.
3 ^ Thy hand destroyed the Gentiles and thou plantedst them~; thou didst afflict the people and cast them out~;
4 ^ for not by their own sword did they inherit the land, and their own arm did not save them~; rather thy right hand and thy arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou wast pleased with them.
5 ^ Thou art thyself my king and my God, who commandest the saving for Jacob.
6 ^ Through thee we will push down our enemies with the horn, and through thy name we will despise them that rise up against us.
7 ^ For I will not trust in my bow, and my sword shall not save me.
8 ^ But thou hast saved us from them that afflict us, and hast put them to shame that hate us.
9 ^ In God shall we glory all the day long, and in thy name we will give praise for ever.
10 ^ But now thou hast cast us off, and put us to shame, and thou, O God, wilt not go out with our armies.
11 ^ Thou hast made us turn our back to our enemies, and they that hated us plundered for themselves.
12 ^ Thou hast given us up like sheep to be eaten, and thou hast scattered us among the nations.
13 ^ Thou hast sold thy people for no price, and there was no reckoning in the exchange of them.
14 ^ Thou hast made us a reproach to our neighbours~; a scoff and derision to them that are round about us.
15 ^ Thou hast made us a byword among the Gentiles~; a shaking of the head among the people.
16 ^ All the day long my shame is before me, and the confusion of my face hath covered me,
17 ^ at the voice of him that reproacheth and detracteth me~; at the face of the enemy and persecutor.
18 ^ All these things have come upon us, yet we have not forgotten thee, and we have not done wickedly in thy covenant.
19 ^ And our heart hath not turned back, and thou hast diverted our steps from thy way,
20 ^ for thou hast humbled us in the place of affliction, and the shadow of death hath covered us.
21 ^ If we have forgotten the name of our God, and if we have spread forth our hands to a strange god,
22 ^ shall not God search out these things~? For he knoweth the secrets of the heart.
23 ^ Because for thy sake we are killed all the day long~; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.
24 ^ Arise~; why sleepest thou, O Lord~? Arise and cast us not off to the end.
25 ^ Why turnest thou thy face away~? Why forgettest our want and our trouble~?
26 ^ For our soul is humbled down to the dust~; our belly cleaveth to the earth.
27 ^ Arise, O Lord, help us, and redeem us for thy name's sake.
