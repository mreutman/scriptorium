1 ^ Praise the Lord, O my soul.
2 ^ I will praise the Lord in my life~; I will sing to my God as long as I shall be.
3 ^ Put not your trust in princes, in the children of men, in whom there is no salvation.
4 ^ His spirit shall go forth, and he shall return into his earth~; in that day all their thoughts shall perish.
5 ^ Blessed is he who hath the God of Jacob for his helper, whose hope is in the Lord his God,
6 ^ who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all things that are in them~; who keepeth truth for ever,
7 ^ who executeth judgment for them that suffer wrong, who giveth food to the hungry. The Lord looseth them that are fettered~;
8 ^ the Lord enlighteneth the blind~; the Lord lifteth up them that are cast down~; the Lord loveth the just.
9 ^ The Lord keepeth the strangers~; he will support the fatherless and the widow, and the ways of sinners he will destroy.
10 ^ The Lord shall reign for ever~; thy God, O Sion, unto generation and generation.
