2 ^ With expectation I have waited for the Lord, and he was attentive to me.
3 ^ And he heard my prayers, and brought me out of the pit of misery and the mire of dregs. And he set my feet upon a rock, and directed my steps.
4 ^ And he put a new canticle into my mouth, a song to our God. Many shall see, and shall fear, and they shall hope in the Lord.
5 ^ Blessed is the man whose trust is in the name of the Lord, and who hath not had regard to vanities and lying follies.
6 ^ Many things thou hast wrought, O Lord my God, thy wonderful works, and in thy thoughts there is no one like to thee. I have declared and I have spoken~; they are multiplied above number.
7 ^ Sacrifice and oblation thou didst not desire~; but thou hast perfected ears for me. Burnt offering and sin offering thou didst not require.
8 ^ Then said I, "Behold I come~; in the head of the book it is written of me,
9 ^ that I should do thy will~; O my God, I have desired it, and thy law in the midst of my heart."
10 ^ I have declared thy justice in a great church~; behold I will not restrain my lips~; O Lord, thou knowest it.
11 ^ I have not hid thy justice within my heart~; I have declared thy truth and thy salvation. I have not concealed thy mercy and thy truth from a great council.
12 ^ Withhold not thou, O Lord, thy tender mercies from me~; thy mercy and thy truth have always upheld me.
13 ^ For evils without number have surrounded me~; my iniquities have overtaken me, and I was not able to see~; they are multiplied above the hairs of my head, and my heart hath forsaken me.
14 ^ Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me. Look down, O Lord, to help me.
15 ^ Let them be confounded and ashamed together, who seek after my soul to take it away~; let them be turned backward and be ashamed, who desire evils to me.
16 ^ Let them immediately bear their confusion, that say to me, "Well done, well done."
17 ^ Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee, and let them say always, "The Lord be magnified," who love thy salvation.
18 ^ But I am a beggar and poor~; the Lord is careful for me. Thou art my helper and my protector~; O my God, be not tarried.
