2 ^ O God, my God, to thee from the dawn do I keep watch. My soul hath thirsted for thee, how many ways to thee my flesh, in a deserted, trackless, waterless land. 
3 ^ So in the sanctuary have I come before thee, to see thy power and thy glory.
4 ^ For thy mercy is better than lives~; thee my lips will praise.
5 ^ Thus I will bless thee all my life long, and in thy name I will lift up my hands.
6 ^ Let my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness, and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips.
7 ^ If I have remembered thee upon my bed, I will meditate on thee in the morning.
8 ^ Because thou hast been my helper, and I will rejoice under the cover of thy wings.
9 ^ My soul hath stuck close to thee~; thy right hand hath received me.
10 ^ But they have sought my soul in vain, they shall go into the lower parts of the earth~;
11 ^ they shall be delivered into the hands of the sword, they shall be the portions of foxes.
12 ^ But the king shall rejoice in God~; all they shall be praised that swear by him, because the mouth is stopped of them that speak wicked things.
