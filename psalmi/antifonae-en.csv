137 ^ In the sight of the angels I praise thee, O my God
138 ^ O Lord, thou searches me throughout and knowest me
139 ^ From the unjust man deliver me, O Lord
140 ^ O Lord, I have cried to thee, hear me
141 ^ Let my portion, O Lord, be in the land of the living
143 ^ Blessed be the Lord, my God 
144 ^ Every day I will praise thee, O Lord
145 ^ I will praise God in my life
146 ^ Let praise be pleasing unto our God
