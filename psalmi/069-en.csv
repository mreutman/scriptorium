2 ^ O God, come to my assistance~; O Lord, make haste to help me.
3 ^ Let them be confounded and ashamed, them who seek my soul.
4 ^ Let them be turned backward and blush for shame that desire evils to me~; let them be presently turned away blushing for shame that say to me, "Well done, well done."
5 ^ Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee, and let them say always, "The Lord be magnified," those who love thy salvation.
6 ^ But I am needy and poor~; O God, help me. Thou art my helper and my deliverer~; O Lord, make no delay.
