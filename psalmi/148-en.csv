1 ^ Praise ye the Lord from the heavens~; praise ye him in the high places.
2 ^ Praise ye him all his angels~; praise ye him all his hosts.
3 ^ Praise ye him, O sun and moon~; praise him, all ye stars and light.
4 ^ Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and thou water that art above the heavens.
5 ^ Let them praise the name of the Lord~; for he spoke, and they were made~; he commanded, and they were created.
6 ^ He hath established them for ever, and for ages of ages~; he hath made a decree, and it shall not pass away.
7 ^ Praise the Lord from the earth, ye dragons and all ye deeps,
8 ^ fire, hail, snow, ice, wind of tempest, which fulfil his word,
9 ^ mountains and all hills, fruitful trees and all cedars,
10 ^ beasts and all cattle, serpents and feathered fowls,
11 ^ kings of the earth and all people, princes and all judges of the earth,
12 ^ young men and maidens, older with the younger~;
13 ^ let them praise the name of the Lord, for exalted is the name of him alone~; the praise of him is above heaven and earth.
14 ^ And he hath exalted the horn of his people~; a hymn to all his saints, to the children of Israel, to a people drawing nigh unto him.
