2 ^ We will praise thee, O God~; we will praise, and we will call upon thy name~; we will relate thy wondrous works.
3 ^ When I shall take a time, I will judge justices.
4 ^ The earth is melted and all that dwell therein~; I have established the pillars thereof.
5 ^ I said to the wicked, "Do not act wickedly," and to the sinners, "Lift not up the horn,
6 ^ lift not up your horn on high~; speak not iniquity against God."
7 ^ For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the desert hills,
8 ^ For God is the judge. One he putteth down, and another he lifteth up~;
9 ^ for in the hand of the Lord there is a cup of strong wine full of mixture, and he hath poured it out from this to that, but the dregs thereof are not emptied~; all the sinners of the earth shall drink.
10 ^ But I will declare for ever~; I will sing to the God of Jacob~;
11 ^ and I will break all the horns of sinners, but the horns of the just shall be exalted.
