1 ^ Bless the Lord, O my soul, and let all that is within me bless his holy name.
2 ^ Bless the Lord, O my soul, and never forget all he hath done for thee.
3 ^ Who forgiveth all thy iniquities~; who healeth all thy diseases.
4 ^ Who redeemeth thy life from destruction~; who crowneth thee with mercy and compassion.
5 ^ Who satisfieth thy desire with good things~; thy youth shall be renewed like the eagle's.
6 ^ The Lord maketh mercies, and judgment for all that suffer wrong.
7 ^ He hath made his ways known to Moses~; his wills to the children of Israel.
8 ^ The Lord is compassionate and merciful~; longsuffering and plenteous in mercy.
9 ^ He will not always be angry, nor will he threaten for ever.
10 ^ He hath not dealt with us according to our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
11 ^ For according to the height of the heaven above the earth, he hath strengthened his mercy towards them that fear him.
12 ^ As far as the rising is from the west, so far hath he removed our iniquities from us.
13 ^ As a father hath compassion on his children, so hath the Lord compassion on them that fear him.
14 ^ For he knoweth our frame~; he remembereth that we are dust.
15 ^ As for man, his days are as grass~; as the flower of the field so shall he flourish.
16 ^ For the spirit passed through him, and he shall not be, and he shall know his place no more.
17 ^ But the mercy of the Lord is from eternity and unto eternity upon them that fear him, and his justice unto children's children,
18 ^ to such as keep his covenant, and are mindful of his commandments to do them.
19 ^ The Lord hath prepared his throne in heaven, and his kingdom shall rule over all.
20 ^ Bless the Lord, all ye his angels~; you that are mighty in strength, that perform his word, hearkening to the voice of his orders.
21 ^ Bless the Lord, all ye his hosts, his ministers, you who do his will.
22 ^ Bless the Lord, all his works~; in every place of his dominion, bless the Lord, O my soul.
