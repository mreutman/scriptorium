1 ^ If it had not been that the Lord was with us, let Israel now say,
2 ^ if it had not been that the Lord was with us, when men rose up against us,
3 ^ perhaps they had swallowed us up alive, when their fury was enkindled against us~;
4 ^ perhaps the water had swallowed us up~; our soul hath passed through a torrent~;
5 ^ perhaps our soul had passed through a water insupportable.
6 ^ Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us to be a prey to their teeth.
7 ^ Our soul like a sparrow hath been delivered from the snare of the hunters~; the snare is broken, and we are delivered.
8 ^ Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
