2 ^ The mercies of the Lord I will sing for ever~; I will show forth thy truth with my mouth to generation and generation,
3 ^ for thou hast said, "Mercy shall be built up for ever in the heavens." Thy truth shall be prepared in them.
4 ^ I have made a covenant with my elect~; I have sworn to David my servant,
5 ^ 'Thy seed will I settle for ever, and I will build up thy throne unto generation and generation.'"
6 ^ The heavens shall confess thy wonders, O Lord, and thy truth in the church of the saints,
7 ^ for who in the clouds can be compared to the Lord~; who among the sons of God shall be like to God~?
8 ^ God, who is glorified in the assembly of the saints, great and terrible above all them that are about him.
9 ^ O Lord God of hosts, who is like to thee~? Thou art mighty, O Lord, and thy truth is round about thee.
10 ^ Thou rulest the power of the sea~; thou also appeasest the motion of the waves.
11 ^ Thou hast humbled the proud one, as one that is slain~; with the arm of thy strength thou hast scattered thy enemies.
12 ^ Thine are the heavens, and thine is the earth~; the world and the fulness thereof thou hast founded.
13 ^ The north and the sea thou hast created~; Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.
14 ^ Thy arm is with might~; let thy hand be strengthened, and thy right hand exalted.
15 ^ Justice and judgment are the preparation of thy throne~; mercy and truth shall go before thy face.
16 ^ Blessed is the people that knoweth jubilation~; O Lord, they shall walk in the light of thy countenance,
17 ^ and in thy name they shall rejoice all the day, and in thy justice they shall be exalted,
18 ^ for thou art the glory of their strength, and in thy good pleasure shall our horn be exalted,
19 ^ for our protection is of the Lord, and of our king the holy one of Israel.
20 ^ Then thou spokest in a vision to thy saints, and saidst, "I have laid help upon one that is mighty, and have exalted one chosen out of my people."
21 ^ I have found David my servant~; with my holy oil I have anointed him.
22 ^ For my hand shall help him, and my arm shall strengthen him.
23 ^ The enemy shall have no advantage over him, nor the son of iniquity have power to hurt him.
24 ^ And I will cut down his enemies before his face, and them that hate him I will put to flight.
25 ^ And my truth and my mercy shall be with him, and in my name shall his horn be exalted.
26 ^ And I will set his hand in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.
27 ^ He shall cry out to me, "Thou art my father, my God, and the support of my salvation."
28 ^ And I will make him my firstborn, high above the kings of the earth.
29 ^ I will keep my mercy for him for ever, and my covenant faithful to him.
30 ^ And I will make his seed to endure for evermore, and his throne as the days of heaven.
31 ^ If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments,
32 ^ if they profane my justices, and keep not my commandments,
33 ^ I will visit their iniquities with a rod, and their sins with stripes.
34 ^ But my mercy I will not take away from him, nor will I do harm in my truth.
35 ^ Neither will I profane my covenant, and the words that proceed from my mouth I will not make void.
36 ^ Once have I sworn by my holiness, if I will lie unto David~;
37 ^ his seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me,
38 ^ and as the moon perfect for ever, and a faithful witness in heaven.
39 ^ But thou hast rejected and despised~; thou hast been angry with my anointed.
40 ^ Thou hast overthrown the covenant of thy servant~; thou hast profaned his sanctuary on the earth.
41 ^ Thou hast broken down all his hedges~; thou hast made his strength fear.
42 ^ All that pass by the way have robbed him~; he is become a reproach to his neighbours.
43 ^ Thou hast set up the right hand of them that oppress him~; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
44 ^ Thou hast turned away the help of his sword, and hast not assisted him in battle.
45 ^ Thou hast made his purification to cease, and thou hast cast his throne down to the ground.
46 ^ Thou hast shortened the days of his time~; thou hast covered him with confusion.
47 ^ How long, O Lord, turnest thou away unto the end~? Shall thy anger burn like fire~?
48 ^ Remember what my substance is~; for hast thou constituted all the children of men in vain~?
49 ^ Who is the man that shall live and not see death, that shall deliver his soul from the hand of hell~?
50 ^ Where are thy ancient mercies, O Lord, according to what thou didst swear to David in thy truth~?
51 ^ Be mindful, O Lord, of the reproach of thy servants, which I have held in my bosom, of many nations.
52 ^ Wherewith thy enemies have reproached, O Lord, wherewith they have reproached the change of thy anointed.
53 ^ Blessed be the Lord for evermore. So be it, so be it.
