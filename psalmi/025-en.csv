1 ^ Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in my innocence, and I have put my hope in the Lord and shall not be weakened.
2 ^ Prove me, O Lord, and try me~; burn my reins and my heart.
3 ^ For thy mercy is before my eyes, and I am well pleased with thy truth.
4 ^ I have not sat with the council of vanity, and with the doers of unjust things I will not enter.
5 ^ I have hated the assembly of the malignant~; and with the wicked I will not sit.
6 ^ I will wash my hands among the innocent, and will compass thy altar, O Lord,
7 ^ that I may hear the voice of thy praise, and tell of all thy wondrous works.
8 ^ I have loved, O Lord, the beauty of thy house, and the place where thy glory dwelleth.
9 ^ Take not away my soul, O God, with the wicked~; nor my life with bloody men,
10 ^ in whose hands are iniquities~; their right hand is filled with bribes.
11 ^ But as for me, I have walked in my innocence~; redeem me, and have mercy on me.
12 ^ My foot hath stood in the direct way~; in the churches I will bless thee, O Lord.
