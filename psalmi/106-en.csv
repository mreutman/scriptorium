3 ^ Out of the countries he gathered them, from the rising and from the setting of the sun, from the north and from the sea.
4 ^ They wandered in a wilderness, in a place without water~; they found not the way of a city for their habitation.

7 ^ And he led them into the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.
8 ^ Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him, and his wonderful works to the children of men,
9 ^ for he hath satisfied the empty soul, and hath filled the hungry soul with good things.
10 ^ Those seated in darkness, and in the shadow of death~; bound in want and in iron,
11 ^ because they had exasperated the words of God, and provoked the counsel of the most High,
12 ^ and their heart was humbled with labours~; they were weakened, and there was none to help them.
13 ^ Then they cried to the Lord when in affliction, and he delivered them out of their distresses.
14 ^ And he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and broke their bonds in sunder.
15 ^ Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him, and his wonderful works to the children of men.
16 ^ Because he hath broken gates of brass, and burst iron bars.

19 ^ And they cried to the Lord in their affliction, and he delivered them out of their distresses.
20 ^ He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.
21 ^ Let the mercies of the Lord give glory to him, and his wonderful works to the children of men.
22 ^ And let them sacrifice the sacrifice of praise, and declare his works with joy.
23 ^ They that go down to the sea in ships, doing business in the great waters,
24 ^ these have seen the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.
25 ^ He spoke, and a wind of tempest arose, and the waves thereof were lifted up.
26 ^ They mount up to the heavens, and they go down to the depths~; their soul pined away with evils.
27 ^ They were troubled, and reeled like a drunken man, and all their wisdom was swallowed up.
28 ^ And they cried to the Lord in their affliction, and he brought them out of their distresses.
29 ^ And he turned the storm into a breeze, and its waves were still.
30 ^ And they rejoiced because they were still, and he brought them to the haven which they wished for.

32 ^ Let them exalt him in the church of the people, and praise him in the chair of the ancients.
33 ^ He hath turned rivers into a wilderness and the sources of waters into dry ground,
34 ^ a fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
35 ^ He hath turned a wilderness into pools of waters, and a dry land into water springs.
36 ^ And hath placed there the hungry~; and they established a city for their habitation.
37 ^ And they sowed fields, and planted vineyards, and they yielded fruit of birth.
38 ^ And he blessed them, and they were multiplied exceedingly, and their cattle he suffered not to decrease.
39 ^ And they were brought to be few, and they were afflicted through the trouble of evils and sorrow.
40 ^ Contempt was poured forth upon their princes, and he caused them to wander where there was no passing, and out of the way.
41 ^ And he helped the poor out of poverty, and made him families like a flock of sheep.
42 ^ The just shall see, and shall rejoice, and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
43 ^ Who is wise, and will keep these things, and will understand the mercies of the Lord~?
