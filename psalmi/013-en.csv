1 ^ The fool hath said in his heart, "There is no God". They are corrupt, and are become abominable in their pursuits~; there is none that doth good, no not one.
2 ^ The Lord hath looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there be any that understand and seek God.
3 ^ They are all gone aside, they are become unprofitable together. There is none that doth good, no not one.
4 ^ Shall not all they know that work iniquity, who devour my people as the food of bread~?
5 ^ They have not called upon the Lord~; there have they trembled for fear, where there was no fear.
6 ^ For the Lord is in the just generation~; you have confounded the counsel of the poor man, but the Lord is his hope.
7 ^ Who shall give out of Sion the salvation of Israel~? When the Lord shall have turned away the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
