1 ^ Why, O God, hast thou cast us off unto the end, thy wrath enkindled against the sheep of thy pasture~?
2 ^ Remember thy congregation, which thou hast possessed from the beginning~; the sceptre of thy inheritance which thou hast redeemed~; mount Sion in which thou hast dwelt.
3 ^ Lift up thy hands against their pride unto the end, how many things the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.
4 ^ And they that hate thee have made their boasts in the midst of thy solemnity~; they have set up their ensigns, signs,
5 ^ and they knew it not as in the going out upon the highest top.
6 ^ As with axes in a wood of trees, they have cut down at once the gates thereof~; with axe and hatchet they have brought it down.
7 ^ They have set fire to thy sanctuary~; they have defiled the dwelling place of thy name on the earth.
8 ^ They said in their heart, the whole kindred of them together, "Let us make to cease all the festival days of God from the land."
9 ^ Our signs we have not seen~; there is now no prophet, and he will know us no more.
10 ^ How long, O God, shall the enemy reproach~? Is the adversary to provoke thy name for ever~?
11 ^ Why dost thou turn away thy hand, and thy right hand out of the midst of thy bosom for ever~?
12 ^ But God is our king before ages~; he hath wrought salvation in the midst of the earth.
13 ^ Thou by thy strength didst make the sea firm~; thou didst crush the heads of the dragons in the waters.
14 ^ Thou hast broken the heads of the dragon~; thou hast given him to be meat for the people of the Ethiopians.
15 ^ Thou hast broken up the fountains and the torrents~; thou hast dried up the rivers of Etam.
16 ^ Thine is the day, and thine is the night~; thou hast made the morning light and the sun.
17 ^ Thou hast made all the borders of the earth~; the summer and the spring, thou hast formed them.
18 ^ Remember this, the enemy hath reproached the Lord, and a foolish people hath provoked thy name.
19 ^ Deliver not up to beasts the souls that confess to thee, and forget not to the end the souls of thy poor.
20 ^ Have regard to thy covenant, for they that are the obscure of the earth have been filled with dwellings of iniq√ºity.
21 ^ Let not the humble be turned away confounded~; the poor and needy shall praise thy name.
22 ^ Arise, O God~; judge thy own cause~; remember thy reproaches with which the foolish man hath reproached thee all the day.
23 ^ Forget not the voices of thy enemies~; the pride of them that hate thee ascendeth continually.
