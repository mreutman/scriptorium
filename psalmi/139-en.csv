2 ^ Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man~; rescue me from the unjust man.
3 ^ Who have devised iniquities in their hearts~; all the day long they designed battles.
4 ^ They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent~; the venom of asps is under their lips.
5 ^ Keep me, O Lord, from the hand of the wicked, and from unjust men deliver me, who have proposed to supplant my steps.
6 ^ The proud have hidden a net for me, and they have stretched out cords for a snare~; they have laid for me a stumblingblock by the wayside.
7 ^ I said to the Lord, "Thou art my God~; hear, O Lord, the voice of my supplication."
8 ^ O Lord, Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast overshadowed my head in the day of battle.
9 ^ Give me not up, O Lord, from my desire to the wicked~; they have plotted against me~; do not thou forsake me, lest they should triumph.
10 ^ The head of their encompassing~; the labour of their lips shall overwhelm them.
11 ^ Burning coals shall fall upon them~; thou wilt cast them down into the fire~; in miseries they shall not be able to stand.
12 ^ A man full of tongue shall not be established in the earth~; evil shall catch the unjust man unto destruction.
13 ^ I know that the Lord will establish the justice of the needy, and the revenge of the poor.
14 ^ But as for the just, they shall give glory to thy name, and the upright shall dwell with thy countenance.
