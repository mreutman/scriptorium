1 ^ Upon the rivers of Babylon, there we sat and wept when we remembered Sion.
2 ^ On the willows in the midst thereof we hung up our instruments,
3 ^ for there they who led us captive asked us words of songs, and they that carried us away a hymn, "Sing ye to us of the songs of Sion."
4 ^ How shall we sing the song of the Lord in a strange land~?
5 ^ If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand be forgotten.
6 ^ Let my tongue cleave to my jaws, if I do not remember thee~; if I make not Jerusalem the beginning of my joy.
7 ^ Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem, who say, "Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof."
8 ^ O miserable daughter of Babylon~; blessed shall he be who shall repay thee thy payment which thou hast paid us.
9 ^ Blessed be he that shall take and dash thy little ones against the rock.
