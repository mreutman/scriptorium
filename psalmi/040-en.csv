2 ^ Blessed is he that understandeth concerning the needy and the poor~; in the evil day the Lord will deliver him.
3 ^ May the Lord preserve him, and give him life, and make him blessed upon the earth, and deliver him not up to the will of his enemies.
4 ^ May the Lord bear help to him on his bed of sorrow~; thou hast turned all his couch in his sickness.
5 ^ I said, "O Lord, be thou merciful to me; heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee."
6 ^ My enemies have spoken evils against me, "When shall he die and his name perish?"
7 ^ And if he came in to see me, he spoke vain things; his heart gathered together iniquity to itself. He went out and spoke in like manner.
8 ^ All my enemies whispered together against me~; they devised evils to me.
9 ^ They established against me an unjust word, "Shall he that sleepeth rise again no more?"
10 ^ For even the man of my peace in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, magnified deciet upon me.
11 ^ But thou, O Lord, have mercy on me and raise me up again, and I will requite them.
12 ^ By this I know that thou hast had a good will for me, because my enemy shall not rejoice over me.
13 ^ But thou hast upheld me by reason of my innocence, and hast established me in thy sight for ever.
14 ^ Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel from eternity, and even unto eternity. So be it. So be it.
