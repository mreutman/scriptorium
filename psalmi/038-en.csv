2 ^ I said, "I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue~; I have set a guard to my mouth, when the sinner stood against me."
3 ^ I was dumb, and was humbled, and kept silence from good things, and my sorrow was renewed.
4 ^ My heart grew hot within me, and in my meditation a fire shall flame out.
5 ^ I spoke with my tongue, "Make know to me, O Lord, my end, and what is the number of my days, that I may know what is wanting to me."
6 ^ Behold thou hast made my days measurable, and my substance is as nothing before thee. Surely all things are vanity, every man living.
7 ^ Surely man passeth as an image~; but even he is disquieted in vain. He storeth up, and he knoweth not for whom he shall gather these things.
8 ^ And now what is my hope~? Is it not the Lord~? And my substance is with thee.
9 ^ Deliver thou me from all my iniquities~; thou hast made me a reproach to the fool.
10 ^ I was dumb, and I opened not my mouth, because thou hast done it.
11 ^ Remove thy scourges from me~; the strength of thy hand hath made me faint in rebukes.
12 ^ Thou hast corrected man for iniquity, and thou hast made his soul to waste away like a spider~; surely in vain is any man disquieted.
13 ^ Hear my prayer, O Lord, and my supplication~; give ear to my tears. Be no silent, for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner as all my fathers were.
14 ^ Forgive me, that I may be refreshed before I go hence, and be no more.
