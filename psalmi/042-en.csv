1 ^ Judge me, O God, and distinguish my cause from the nation that is not holy~; deliver me from the unjust and deceitful man.
2 ^ For thou art, O God, my strength~; why hast thou cast me off, and why do I go sorrowful, whilst the enemy afflicteth me~?
3 ^ Send forth thy light and thy truth~; these have conducted me, and they brought me unto thy holy hill and into thy tabernacles.
4 ^ And I will go in to the altar of God, to God who giveth joy to my youth. To thee, O God my God, I will give praise upon the harp.
5 ^ Why art thou sad, O my soul~? And why dost thou disquiet me~?
6 ^ Hope in God, for I will still give praise to him, the salvation of my countenance, and my God.
