1 ^ The Lord is my light and my salvation~; whom shall I fear~? The Lord is the protector of my life~; of whom shall I be afraid~?
2 ^ Whilst the wicked draw near against me, so as to eat my flesh, they that trouble me and my enemies, have been weakened and have fallen.
3 ^ If armies in camp should stand together against me, my heart shall not fear. If a battle should rise up against me, in this will I be confident.
4 ^ One thing I have asked of the Lord, this will I seek after, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life~; that I may see the delight of the Lord, and may visit his temple.
5 ^ For he hath hidden me in his tabernacle~; in the day of evils he hath protected me in the secret place of his tabernacle.
6 ^ He hath exalted me upon a rock, and now he hath lifted up my head above my enemies. I have gone round, and have offered up in his tabernacle a sacrifice of jubilation~; I will sing and I will recite a psalm to the Lord.
7 ^ Hear, O Lord, my voice, with which I have cried to thee~; have mercy on me and hear me.
8 ^ My heart hath spoke to thee~; my face hath sought thee. Thy face, O Lord, I will seek.
9 ^ Turn not away thy face from me~; decline not in thy wrath from thy servant. Be thou my helper~; forsake me not, and do not thou despise me, O God my Saviour.
10 ^ For my father and my mother have left me~; but the Lord hath taken me up.
11 ^ Set me, O Lord, a law in thy way, and guide me in the right path, because of my enemies.
12 ^ Let me not be delivered over to the will of them that trouble me, for unjust witnesses have risen up against me, and iniquity hath lied to itself.
13 ^ I believe to see the good things of the Lord in the land of the living.
14 ^ Expect the Lord~; do manfully, and let thy heart take courage, and wait thou for the Lord.
