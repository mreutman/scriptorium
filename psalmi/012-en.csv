2 ^ How long, O Lord, wilt thou forget me unto the end~? How long dost thou turn away thy face from me~?
3 ^ How long shall I take counsels in my soul, sorrow in my heart all the day~? How long shall my enemy be exalted over me~?
4 ^ Consider, and hear me, O Lord my God. Enlighten my eyes, that I never sleep in death,
5 ^ lest at any time my enemy say, "I have prevailed against him"~; they that trouble me, will rejoice when I am moved.
6 ^ But I have trusted in thy mercy~; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation. I will sing to the Lord who giveth me good things, and I will sing to the name of the Lord the most high.
