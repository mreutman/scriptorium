4 ^ I will praise thee among the people, O Lord, and I will sing unto thee among the nations,
5 ^ for thy mercy is great above the heavens, and thy truth even unto the clouds.
6 ^ Be thou exalted above the heavens, O God, and thy glory over all the earth,
7 ^ that thy beloved may be delivered~; save with thy right hand and hear me.
8 ^ God hath spoken in his holiness, "I will rejoice, and I will divide Sichem and I will mete out the vale of tabernacles.
9 ^ Giliad is mine, and Manasses is mine, and Ephraim the protection of my head~; Judah is my king.
10 ^ Moab is the pot of my hope~; over Idumea I will stretch out my shoe~; the aliens are become my friends."
11 ^ Who will bring me into the strong city~? Who will lead me into Idumea~?
12 ^ Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off~? And wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our armies~?
13 ^ O grant us help from trouble, for vain is the help of man.
14 ^ Through God we shall do mightily, and he will bring our enemies to nothing.
