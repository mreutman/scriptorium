1 ^ The Lord ruleth me, and I shall want nothing.
2 ^ He hath set me in a place of pasture~; he hath brought me up to the water of refreshment.
3 ^ He hath converted my soul~; he hath led me on the paths of justice for his own name's sake.
4 ^ For though I should walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I will fear no evils, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they have comforted me.
5 ^ Thou hast prepared a table before me against them that afflict me. Thou hast anointed my head with oil, and my chalice which inebreateth me, how excellent it is.
6 ^ And thy mercy will follow me all the days of my life, and that I may dwell in the house of the Lord unto length of days.
