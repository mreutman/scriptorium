2 ^ O thou that rulest Israel, give ear; thou that leadest Joseph like a sheep. Thou that sittest upon the cherubim, shine forth.
3 ^ Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh stir up thy might, and come to save us.
4 ^ O God, convert us, and show us thy face, and we shall be saved.
5 ^ O Lord God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy servant~?
6 ^ How long wilt thou feed us with the bread of tears, and give us for our drink tears in measure~?
7 ^ Thou hast made us to be a contradiction to our neighbours, and our enemies have scoffed at us.
8 ^ O God of hosts, convert us, and show thy face, and we shall be saved.
9 ^ Thou hast brought a vineyard out of Egypt~; thou hast cast out the Gentiles and planted it.
10 ^ Thou wast the guide of its journey in its sight~; thou plantedst the roots thereof, and it filled the land.
11 ^ The shadow of it covered the hills, and the branches thereof the cedars of God.
12 ^ It stretched forth its branches unto the sea, and its boughs unto the river.
13 ^ Why hast thou broken down the hedge thereof, so that all they who pass by the way do pluck it~?
14 ^ The boar from the wood hath laid it waste, and a singular wild beast hath devoured it.
15 ^ O God of hosts, be turned back~; look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vineyard,
16 ^ and perfect the same which thy right hand hath planted, and upon the son of man whom thou hast confirmed for thyself.
17 ^ It is burned with fire and dug up~; at the rebuke of thy countenance they shall perish.
18 ^ Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, and upon the son of man whom thou hast confirmed for thyself.
19 ^ And we depart not from thee~; thou shalt quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.
20 ^ O Lord God of hosts, convert us, and show thy face, and we shall be saved.
