2 ^ It is good to give praise to the Lord, and to sing to thy name, O most High~;
3 ^ to show forth thy mercy in the morning, and thy truth in the night,
4 ^ upon an instrument of ten strings, upon the psaltery, with a canticle upon the harp.
5 ^ For thou hast given me, O Lord, a delight in thy doings, and in the works of thy hands I shall rejoice.
6 ^ How great are thy works, O Lord. Thy thoughts are exceeding deep.
7 ^ The senseless man shall not know, nor will the fool understand these things.
8 ^ When the wicked shall spring up as grass, and all the workers of iniquity shall appear, that they may perish for ever and ever~;
9 ^ but thou art the Most High for evermore, O Lord.
10 ^ For behold thy enemies, O Lord, for behold thy enemies shall perish, and all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
11 ^ And my horn shall be exalted like that of the unicorn, and my old age in plentiful mercy.
12 ^ And my eye hath looked down upon my enemies, and my ear shall hear of the downfall of the malignant that rise up against me.
13 ^ The just shall flourish like the palm tree~; he shall grow up like the cedar of Lebanon.
14 ^ They that are planted in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God they shall flourish.
15 ^ They shall still increase in a fruitful old age, and shall be well treated,
16 ^ that they may show that the Lord our God is righteous, and there is no iniquity in him.
