4 ^ The words of the wicked have prevailed over us, and thou wilt pardon our transgressions.
5 ^ Blessed is he whom thou hast chosen and taken to thee~; he shall dwell in thy courts. We shall be filled with the good things of thy house~; holy is thy temple,
6 ^ wonderful in justice. Hear us, O God, our salvation, who art the hope of all the ends of the earth, and in the sea afar off.
7 ^ Thou who preparest the mountains by thy strength, being girded with power~;
8 ^ who troublest the depth of the sea, the noise of its waves. The Gentiles shall be troubled,
9 ^ and they that dwell in the uttermost borders shall be afraid at thy signs~; the departures of the morning and of the evening thou shalt delight.
10 ^ Thou hast visited the earth and inebriated it~; thou hast many ways enriched it. The river of God is filled with water~; thou hast prepared their food, for so is its preparation.
11 ^ Inebriate the streams thereof~; multiply its fruits~; it shall spring up and rejoice in its showers.
12 ^ Thou shalt bless the crown of the year of thy goodness, and thy fields shall be filled with plenty.
13 ^ The beautiful things of the wilderness shall grow fat, and the hills shall be girded about with joy.
14 ^ The rams of the flock are clothed, and the vales shall abound with corn~; they shall shout, yea they shall sing a hymn.
