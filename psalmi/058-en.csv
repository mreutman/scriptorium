2 ^ Deliver me from my enemies, O my God, and from them that rise up against me free me.
3 ^ Deliver me from them that work iniquity, and save me from bloody men.
4 ^ For behold they have caught my soul~; the mighty have rushed in upon me.
5 ^ Neither is it my iniquity, nor my sin, O Lord~; without iniquity have I run, and have I directed.
6 ^ Rise up thou to meet me, and behold. And thou, O Lord, the God of hosts, the God of Israel, attend to visit all the nations~; have no mercy on all them that work iniquity.
7 ^ They shall return at evening, and shall suffer hunger as dogs, and shall go round about the city.
8 ^ Behold they shall speak with their mouth, and a sword is in their lips~; for who has heard~?
9 ^ But thou, O Lord, shalt laugh at them~; thou shalt bring all the nations to nothing.
10 ^ I will keep my strength to thee, for thou art my protector
11 ^ My God, his mercy shall prevent me~; God shall let me see over my enemies.
12 ^ Slay them not, lest at any time my people forget. Scatter them by thy power, and bring them down, my protector, O Lord,
13 ^ a sin of their mouth, a word of their lips, and let them be taken in their pride. And for their cursing and lying they shall be talked of,
14 ^ when they are consumed, when they are consumed by thy wrath, and they shall be no more. And they shall know that God will rule Jacob, and all the ends of the earth.
15 ^ They shall return at evening, and shall suffer hunger as dogs, and shall go round about the city.
16 ^ They shall be scattered abroad to eat, if truely they shall not be filled, and shall murmur.
17 ^ But I will sing thy strength, and will extol thy mercy in the morning. For thou art become my support, and my refuge, in the day of my trouble.
18 ^ O my helper, will unto thee will I sing, for thou art God my defence~; my God, my mercy.
