1 ^ Lord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle, or who shall rest in thy holy hill~?
2 ^ He who walketh without blemish and worketh justice, who speaketh truth in his heart,
3 ^ who hath not used deceit in his tongue, nor hath done evil to his neighbour, and hath not taken up a reproach against his neighbours.
4 ^ In his sight the malignant is brought to nothing, but he glorifieth them that fear the Lord. He that sweareth to his neighbour and deceiveth not,
5 ^ he that hath not put out his money to usury, nor taken bribes against the innocent~; he that doth these things, shall not be moved for ever.
