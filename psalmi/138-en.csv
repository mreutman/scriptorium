1 ^ Lord, thou hast proved me, and known me.
2 ^ Thou hast known my sitting down and my rising up~; thou hast understood my thoughts afar off.
3 ^ My path and my line thou hast searched out, and thou hast foreseen all my ways,
4 ^ for there is no speech in my tongue.
5 ^ Behold, O Lord, thou hast known all things, the last and those of old~; thou hast formed me, and hast laid thy hand upon me.
6 ^ Thy knowledge is become wonderful to me~; it is high, and I cannot reach to it.
7 ^ Whither shall I go from thy spirit, or whither shall I flee from thy face~?
8 ^ If I ascend into heaven, thou art there~; if I descend into the depths, thou art present.
9 ^ If I take my wings early in the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,
10 ^ even there also shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.
11 ^ And I said, "Perhaps darkness shall cover me, and night shall be my light in my pleasures,"
12 ^ but darkness shall not be dark to thee, and night shall be light all the day~; for just as its darkness is, so also is its light.
13 ^ For thou hast possessed my reins~; thou hast protected me from my mother's womb.
14 ^ I will praise thee, for thou art fearfully magnified~; wonderful are thy works, and my soul knoweth right well.
15 ^ My bone is not hidden from thee, which thou hast made in secret, and my substance in the lower parts of the earth.
16 ^ Thy eyes did see my imperfect being, and in thy book all shall be written~; days shall be formed, and no one in them.
17 ^ But to me thy friends are made exceedingly honourable, O God~; their principality is exceedingly strengthened.
18 ^ I will number them, and they shall be multiplied above the sand~; I rose up, and am still with thee.
19 ^ If thou shouldst kill the wicked, O God~; ye men of blood, depart from me,
20 ^ because you say in thought, "They shall receive thy cities in vain."
21 ^ Have I not hated them, O Lord, that hated thee, and pined away because of thy enemies~?
22 ^ I have hated them with a perfect hatred, and they are become enemies to me.
23 ^ Prove me, O God, and know my heart~; examine me, and know my paths.
24 ^ And see whether the way of iniquity is in me, and lead me in the eternal way.
