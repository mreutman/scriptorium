3 ^ O God, thou hast cast us off, and hast destroyed us~; thou hast been angry, and hast had mercy on us.
4 ^ Thou hast moved the earth, and hast troubled it~; heal thou the breaches thereof, for it has been moved.
5 ^ Thou hast shown thy people hard things~; thou hast made us drink the wine of sorrow.
6 ^ Thou hast given a warning to them that fear thee, that they may flee from before the bow, that thy beloved may be delivered.
7 ^ Save me with thy right hand, and hear me.
8 ^ God hath spoken in his holy place, "I will rejoice, and I will divide Sichem, and will mete out the vale of tabernacles."
9 ^ GÃ¬liad is mine, and Manasseh is mine, and Ephraim is the strength of my head. Judah is my king~;
10 ^ Moab is the pot of my hope. Into Idumea will I stretch out my shoe~; to me the foreigners are made subject.
11 ^ Who will bring me into the strong city~? Who will lead me into Idumea~?
12 ^ Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off~? And wilt not thou, O God, go out with our armies~?
13 ^ Give us help from trouble, for vain is the salvation of man.
14 ^ Through God we shall do mightily, and he shall bring to nothing them that afflict us.
